 What is Session Persistence?

When you refresh a website, the application state in memory (Redux) gets reset. To ensure that your daily todos persist even after refreshing the page, we can save them into the browser's storage. There are two common options:

    localStorage: Data is persistent even after closing the browser.
    sessionStorage: Data persists until the browser is closed.
